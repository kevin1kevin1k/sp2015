1. Execution
	Just "make" to compile the three .c files.
	To remove binaries, use "make rm".
	It's also fine to compile _.c via "make _".

2. Self-Examination
	I think I finish all the 8 criteria.
	If there is a segmentation fault, I think there's some problem
	in the customer and customer_EDF provided, and can be solved
	by deleting the _log files before running. Thanks.
